    "1. **df_resources**: consisting of the id, and name of the recourses available.\n",
    "2. **df_projects**: consists of id, name of the project, and duration of the project based on start and end time.\n",
    "3. **df_expertise**: consists of the id, id of the recourse, and id of the project. This table is also called the allocation table.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we want to find a (or all) feasible solution for completing the projects with the available resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the last table `df_expertise`, there are some situations when several resources are allocated to a single project.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a limitation which is some projects have overlap for their duration based on the start and the end time of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Restriction**: One resource can not be allocated to two (or more) projects when there is an overlap in the timetable. However, a single resource can work on more than one project if there is no overlap in their timing.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can define a solution by a list of numbers like `[3, 4, 2, 1, 5, 1]`, the index of this list is the project and the elements are the id of the resources.\n",
